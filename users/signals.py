# Django includes a “signal dispatcher” which helps decoupled applications get notified when 
# actions occur elsewhere in the framework. In a nutshell, signals allow certain senders 
# to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. They’re especially useful 
# when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events.
